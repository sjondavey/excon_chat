      "        (vii) The provisions of Regulation 12 must at all times be complied with by the importer.\n",
      "        (viii) Authorised Dealers should advise their clients that payments for current account transactions as provided for elsewhere in the Authorised Dealer Manual may be effected abroad against the presentation of documentary evidence and such payments will not be deducted from an individual's single discretionary allowance limit.\n",
