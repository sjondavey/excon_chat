1||Although the Republic of South Africa (South Africa) has had exchange controls since 1939, the foundation thereof is the Currency and Exchanges Act, 1933 (Act No.  9 of 1933) (the Act) and the Exchange Control Regulations (Regulations) promulgated thereunder in terms of section 9(1) of the Act, on 1961-12-01. In terms of these Regulations, the control over South Africa's foreign currency reserves, including accruals thereto and spending thereof is vested in the Treasury, who is authorised to grant permissions or exemptions for certain transactions, subject to certain conditions. Although these permissions or exemptions which were previously referred to as ‘Rulings' have no statutory force, they have the effect of law. ‘Treasury', is however defined to mean, in relation to any matter contemplated in the Regulations, the Minister of Finance or an officer in the Department of Finance (now the National Treasury) who, by virtue of the division of work in that Department, deals with the matter on the authority of the Minister of Finance.|||False|Legal context|164

The Financial Surveillance Department of the South African Reserve Bank (Financial Surveillance Department) is therefore responsible for the day to day administration of exchange controls in South Africa.|||False|Legal context|77

3|(a)|Subscription to and/or purchase of zero coupon bonds|||False|G.(D)(viii)(a)|8
4|(aa)|A deep discount security is a bond that makes low or, in the case of a zero coupon bond, no periodic interest payments and is, therefore, sold at a large discount to its nominal value. The buyer of such a bond receives a rate of return from the gradual appreciation of the security, which is redeemed at nominal value on a specified maturity date.|||False|G.(D)(viii)(a)(aa)|64
3|(b)|Subscription to and/or purchase of stripped treasury certificates|||False|G.(D)(viii)(b)|8
4|(aa)|Stripped treasury certificates are a type of zero coupon bond, but are not issued by a corporate entity to raise funds. They are usually created by an investment (merchant) bank buying blocks of long-term securities issued by the government (treasury stocks) and separating (stripping) the future coupon payments and principal redemption values. Usually a special purpose vehicle is set up to carry out the stripping. Zero coupon bonds are then issued by the special purpose vehicle with maturity values determined by and secured on the coupons and redemptions of the underlying treasury stocks. The treasury stocks are held in trust by a custodian bank which collects the coupons to pay off each tranche of the zero coupon bonds. The final tranche is redeemed out of the redemption value of the block of treasury stocks.|||False|G.(D)(viii)(b)(aa)|134

5|(5)|interest payments in a range of currencies.|||False|G.(D)(viii)(c)(aa)(5)|7
3|(d)|Subscription to and/or purchase of asset backed securities|||False|G.(D)(viii)(d)|8
4|(aa)|With asset backed securities, specific assets serve as collateral for the securities and generate the payment streams that are used to finance the payment of interest and principal to the investors in the security (debt instrument). Typically, the issuer cannot easily convert assets into cash, and the assets are then securitised.|||False|G.(D)(viii)(d)(aa)|51
4|(bb)|In general, any receivable that has a contractual cash flow is potentially suitable for securitisation. Assets to be securitised or unitised must have some, if not all, of the following characteristics:|||False|G.(D)(viii)(d)(bb)|31
5|(1)|the cash flow generated from the assets should be received periodically in accordance with a predetermined schedule; (2) the actual cash flows generated from the assets should be predictable, or statistics should be available for their expected performance (e.g. a history of defaults and prepayments);|||False|G.(D)(viii)(d)(bb)(1)|45
5|(3)|the assets should be large enough in number and total value for it to be economical to issue them in securitised form;|||False|G.(D)(viii)(d)(bb)(3)|22
5|(4)|there should be sufficient similarity in the characteristics of the assets (e.g. the final maturity date) so that their cash flows can be pooled; and|||False|G.(D)(viii)(d)(bb)(4)|25
5|(5)|the assets should be of good saleable quality (i.e. there is a low risk of default) or some form of credit enhancement may be required (e.g. a guarantee).|||False|G.(D)(viii)(d)(bb)(5)|28
4|(cc)|There are two basic forms of asset backed securities. The choice of structure is generally regulatory and tax-driven. The first form is usually referred to as pass-through securities, which are sold to investors who receive participation certificates. The payments of both interest and capital received by the issuer from the pool of assets are passed through directly to the investors in proportion to their participation.|||False|G.(D)(viii)(d)(cc)|65
4|(dd)|The second form is the issue of asset backed bonds structured as a financing transaction. Debt securities are issued which are backed by collateral (i.e. the assets). The cash flows generated from the assets are not passed directly through to investors, but are used to pay coupon interest on the bonds and then redeem principal in a predetermined order. The pool of assets will often have been sold to a special purpose vehicle, which will in turn issue the securities. The special purpose vehicle may or may not be a subsidiary of the original owner.|||False|G.(D)(viii)(d)(dd)|95

2|(ii)|Switch transactions|||True|G.(E)(ii)|2
2||In switch transactions, however, where a stockbroker simultaneously sells one security for a non-resident and buys another, credit may be allowed on a purely temporary basis to bridge the gap pending receipt of payment for the security sold. Such facilities must be regarded as valid for the interim period only and may not be unduly protracted.|||False|G.(E)(ii)|56
2|(iii)|Repurchase agreements|||True|G.(E)(iii)|2
3|(a)|A repurchase transaction, also known as a carry deal, is an agreement whereby one party (known as the seller-borrower) sells a security to the other party (the buyer-lender) with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the security at a fixed future date at a stipulated price. While the legal form of the transaction is a sale and a repurchase, in substance the seller-borrower borrows the proceeds of the sale from the buyer-lender and deposits the securities as collateral. The difference between the sale and repurchase price of the security is essentially an interest cost to the seller-borrower.|||False|G.(E)(iii)(a)|96
3|(b)|Repurchase transactions entered into with a non-resident seller-borrower counter party are deemed to be a form of financial assistance and therefore subject to the provisions of Regulation 3(1)(e) and (f).|||False|G.(E)(iii)(b)|30
3|(c)|Authorised Dealers may, however, enter into repurchase transactions with a non-resident seller-borrower, provided that such transactions are fully secured either by providing cash cover in Rand or the pledge of unencumbered non-resident owned local assets. Any additional margin requirements are to be provided similarly.|||False|G.(E)(iii)(c)|44
3|(d)|The aforementioned provisions would also apply to any repurchase transactions undertaken by an Authorised Dealer with emigrant seller-borrower counterparties in respect of their remaining portfolios.|||False|G.(E)(iii)(d)|25
3|(e)|Authorised Dealers are exempted from the provisions of Regulation 3(1)(e) and/or (f), provided that the terms and conditions of this subsection are strictly complied with.|||False|G.(E)(iii)(e)|25
3|(f)|The interest factor or cost of the carry may be settled in foreign currency or over a Non-resident Rand account, provided that the rate is reasonable having regard to current interest rates. In the case of emigrants the provisions of section B.3(B) of the Authorised Dealer Manual would, however, continue to apply.

3|(a)|Securities lending is the transfer of ownership of a locally quoted security, including inward listed securities from a lender to a borrower in exchange for collateral of an agreed type and for an agreed value. The transaction is accompanied by a pledge from the borrower to the lender to reverse the transaction at a future date by the redelivery of equivalent locally quoted securities. Collateral is usually required by lenders to cover the counter party risk involved in securities lending. Loans of locally quoted securities can be made either on a fixed term or on an open-ended (or call) basis. Open-ended loans will continue until either the lender or the borrower decides to terminate the loan. In both cases, on termination, the lender will ordinarily receive back from the borrower locally quoted securities of a similar kind to those lent and in exchange the lender will return the borrower's collateral. For the period of the loan the lender retains all the rights attached to the locally quoted securities lent, except the right to vote. Thus all dividends and corporate action entitlements pass back to the lender through the borrower.|||False|G.(E)(iv)(a)|189
3|(b)|Securities lending transactions entered into with a non-resident counter party are deemed to be either a form of financial assistance to the non-resident borrower and therefore subject to the provisions of Regulation 3(1)(e) and/or (f) or a borrowing by a resident from a non-resident lender which is subject to the provisions of Regulation 2, amongst others.|||False|G.(E)(iv)(b)|56
3|(c)|Authorised Dealers may, however, enter into securities lending transactions with a non-resident borrower, provided that such transactions are fully secured by cash cover in Rand, the transfer of unencumbered non-resident owned local collateral securities or the pledge of unencumbered non-resident owned local assets. Similarly, securities lending transactions with a non-resident lender must be fully secured by cash cover in Rand, the outright transfer of unencumbered resident owned local collateral securities or the pledge of local assets. Any additional margin requirements are to be provided on the same basis. The securities in question may not be held outside of South Africa and both legs of any transfer of securities as collateral must be administered by a South African resident custodian.|||False|G.(E)(iv)(c)|119

3|(f)|The interest factor or lending fee accruing to the lender may be settled in foreign currency or over a Non-resident Rand account, provided that the rate is reasonable having regard to current interest rates. In the case of emigrants the provisions of section B.3(B) of the Authorised Dealer Manual would, however, continue to apply. All other cash flows related to securities lending transactions would be settled over the Non-resident Rand account or emigrant's capital account of the non-resident or emigrant concerned.|||False|G.(E)(iv)(f)|81
