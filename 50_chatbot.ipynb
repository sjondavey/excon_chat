These documents must be presented at the time foreign currency payments for imports are made where the goods have already been cleared by Customs, or in the case of advance payments in excess of R50 000 within four months of the date of payment.

Should no response or an unsatisfactory response be received, the matter should at any time after the four month period has lapsed but not later than ten months from the original payment date, be reported to the Financial Surveillance Department. In this regard, a fully motivated application must be submitted providing details of the transaction(s) including the customer name, value date, transaction reference number, Rand amount, and the Customs client number (CCN) reported on the FinSurv Reporting System. The outstanding advance payment transaction may be discharged from the Import Verification System only after confirmation has been received from the Financial Surveillance Department.\n",

The Import Verification System must be updated accordingly.\n",
      "        (vii) Authorised Dealers should note that non-compliance with the above directives will be viewed in a serious light.\n",
