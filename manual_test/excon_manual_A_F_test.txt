Legal context (#Heading)
    Although the Republic of South Africa (South Africa) has had exchange controls since 1939, the foundation thereof is the Currency and Exchanges Act, 1933 (Act No.  9 of 1933) (the Act) and the Exchange Control Regulations (Regulations) promulgated thereunder in terms of section 9(1) of the Act, on 1961-12-01. In terms of these Regulations, the control over South Africa's foreign currency reserves, including accruals thereto and spending thereof is vested in the Treasury, who is authorised to grant permissions or exemptions for certain transactions, subject to certain conditions. Although these permissions or exemptions which were previously referred to as ‘Rulings' have no statutory force, they have the effect of law. ‘Treasury', is however defined to mean, in relation to any matter contemplated in the Regulations, the Minister of Finance or an officer in the Department of Finance (now the National Treasury) who, by virtue of the division of work in that Department, deals with the matter on the authority of the Minister of Finance. 
    The Minister of Finance has in terms of Regulation 22E delegated to the Governor, a Deputy Governor, the Head of the Financial Surveillance Department as well as other officials in the Financial Surveillance Department, the powers, functions and duties assigned to and imposed on the Treasury under the Regulations. The Financial Surveillance Department of the South African Reserve Bank (Financial Surveillance Department) is therefore responsible for the day to day administration of exchange controls in South Africa. 
    Section 9(5)(a) of the Act provides for the issuing of Orders and Rules, the current set of which was also promulgated on 1961-12-01. The Orders and Rules contain various orders, rules, exemptions, forms and procedural arrangements.
